# Hippocampal Volume Quantification Alzheimer's progression

3D medical images of brain MRIs were used to train a convolutional neural network to segment the hippocampus region of the brain. This model was integreated with a clinical network to quantify hippocampal volume for Alzheimer's progression detection or monitoring.
The data was in NIFTI format. UNET architecture was used for the CNN. 

Project completed as part of Udacity AI for Healthcare Nanodegree.
